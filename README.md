# Marie Kondō Kawaii Core

This website was made during the **Hyperloop Workshop** with [Vera van de Seyp](https://veravandeseyp.com) at Klasse Grafik from 4.–8. November 2024. The main goal was to learn a bit of p5.js with a focus on animations. 

The starting point for the website should be a contradiction – ours is the strong desire to be with cute things conflicting with an eqally strong desire for an entirely unclutterd space.
