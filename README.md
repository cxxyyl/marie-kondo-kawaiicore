# Day 1
## Contradictions
always sleeping – always tired
want speaking english – don't want to speak english (tiering)
wanting to meet people – beeing tired of meeting people
**minimal life – maximal trinkets**

enjoying unhealthy food – but know that it's not good
liking pets – don't want to own pets
like to spend time doing nothing – not enough time 

## Team Names

## Few things about p5.js
function setup -> sets up the canvas, which can be a html element
function draw –> runs with 60fps and this is where the magic (animation) happens

for files -> need to run local server

## How will it work
- Assets Folder with img or svg
- Heatmap to check where stuff is already generated
	- updates everytime someting is placed/generated

### Logic
- what are the rules for element distribution
	- expands radially from origin
	- do the elements overlap?
	- what is the spacing between elements
	- how is a specific element chosen?
	-  is there a randomness in scattering or is everything "neatly in a grid?"
		- how detailed is the grid
		- can I change it (slider?)
- how big are the elements? (scalable?)
- what happens if two sources collide?
